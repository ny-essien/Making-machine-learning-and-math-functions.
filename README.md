# Making-machine-learning-and-math-functions.
This project is aimed at understanding how different machine learning and mathematical concepts
like standardization,normalization accuracy score, absolute value, standard deviation etc are done
in python without the use of deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and modules like the python math module.

The goal is to better improve my understanding on this concepts as well as developed better codes as a python engineer.
